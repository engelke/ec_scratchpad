    "Elliptic curves are obviously symmetric about the x-axis, so if *P* = (x, y) is on the curve, so is its reflection (x, -y). We define the reflection of a point across the x axis as *-P*, the arithmetic inverse of the point *P*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two points *P* and *Q* on the curve, draw a line connecting them. If there are no repeated roots, this line will intersect the curve in at most one more point *R*. We define *P* + *Q* to be *-R*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Why? Bear with us. This approach leads the points on the curve to form a group over this operation.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are cases where we can't use this geometric approach for addition. For example, we can't use it to add *P* and *-P*, because the line through them is vertical and never intersects the curve at any other point. To solve this we define an additional \"point on the curve\" called *infinity* but denoted ùìû. This point is the arithmetic identity (so I have no idea why it isn't called zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for any point *P*, we have *P* + ùìû = *P*, ùìû + *P* = *P*, and *P* + *-P* = ùìû.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can't add a point to itself (double it) with this geometric approach, because the single point doesn't determine a line. Instead we take a tangent to the curve, which will intersect the curve at a single point *R*. That point's inverse *-R* is defined as *P* + *P*.\n",
