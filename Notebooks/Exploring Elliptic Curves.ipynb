    "Elliptic curves are obviously symmetric about the y-axis, so if *P* = (x, y) is on the curve, so is its reflection *-P* = (x, -y). We define the reflection of a point across the y axis as the arithmetic inverse of the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two points *P* and *Q* on the curve, draw a line connecting them. If there are no repeated roots, this line will intersect the curve in at most one more point *R*. We define *P* + *Q* to be *-R*.\n",

    "*(Why? Bear with us. This approach leads the points on the curve to form a group over this operation.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are cases where we can't use this geometric approach for addition. For example, we can't use it to add *P* and *-P*, because the line through them is vertical and never intersects the curve at any other point. To solve this we define an additional \"point on the curve\" called infinity but denoted **O**. This point is the arithmetic identity (so I have no idea why it isn't called zero).\n",

    "Finally, we can't add a point to itself (double it) with this geometric approach, because the single point doesn't determine a line. Instead we take a tangent to the curve, which will intersect the curve at a single point *R*. That point's inverse *-R* is defined as *P* + *P*.\n",
